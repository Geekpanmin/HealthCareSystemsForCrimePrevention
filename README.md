HealthCare Systems for Crime Prevention

Problem Statement: 
 
Many cities in the USA witness an immense rise in criminal activities over the years. Citizens of the city have to put up with crimes like robbery, assault, burglary, murder etc. on a day to day basis.
 
Purpose: 
 
The criminal activities are increasing day by day in many parts of the country. The purpose of this project is to curb down or possibly eliminate the criminal activities by predicting human behavior and activities in order to serve a crime free city. 
 
Solution Proposed:
 
We are trying to build an ecosystem in which each person has a sensor associated with him/her which is used to predict his behavior and activities beforehand by monitoring and tracking the person's past medical history, criminal history, and vital signs. If any of the parameters go above the threshold value, then the alert will be sent to a department which can aid at the location. There can be two cases: Firstly, Before the crime is committed, it can be stopped or Secondly, After the crime is committed, the results can be used to find the criminals.
